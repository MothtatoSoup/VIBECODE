I tried my best to recreate the Sans Boss fight from undertale.
I did it in Scratch, a website that uses blocks of logic to create games and other things
I used ChatGPT to help me with the code
I did code some of the easier things on my own (ie show and hide, when to play sounds or when to activate something) and did get AI assistance with other things
The only thing that is all AI would be the movement. There is an easier way to do that however Chatgpt wanted me to code it within an if statment because of the difrence
in how you move based on if the soul is red or blue
I'm honestley really proud of just doing this as a whole. I never really had the motivation to do something and never considered working with AI.
If I had more time I honestly would want to fully recreate the Boss Fight
